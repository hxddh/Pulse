/// Resource loading must never be able to kill the app.

/// Every release from 0.21 to 0.23.0 shipped a DMG that crashed on launch:
/// `package.sh` built a malformed resource bundle, `Bundle(url:)` returned nil,
/// and the compiler-generated `Bundle.module` accessor called `fatalError()`
/// while drawing the menu bar icon. `swift test` was green the whole time,
/// because tests never load the packaged bundle.
///
/// These do not prove the DMG is correct — only `scripts/package_check.py`,
/// which reads the built .app, can do that. What they pin is the part that
/// belongs in the app: a resource that cannot be found degrades instead of
/// trapping.
